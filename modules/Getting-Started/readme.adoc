== Getting Started with this Workshop

== Goals:
Connect to AWS CLoud 9 Develeopment IDE.
Install the CF CLI
Log into the Pivotal CLoud Foundry Application Manager.

Step 1:: Connecting to you AWS Cloud 9 developement environment:

AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine. Cloud9 also provides a seamless experience for developing serverless applications enabling you to easily define resources, debug, and switch between local and remote execution of serverless applications. With Cloud9, you can quickly share your development environment with your team, enabling you to pair program and track each other's inputs in real time.

Step 2:: Clone Lab repo:
----
cd ~/environment
git clone https://github.com/rniksch/AWS-PCF-Workshop.git
----

Step 3:: add the cf CLI repo:
----
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudfoundry-cli.repo https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/fedora/cloudfoundry-cli.repo
----

Step 4:: Install cf CLI:
----
sudo yum install cf-cli
----

Step 5:: Login to the PCF Foundation using the cf CLI:
----
cf login -a https://api.sys.pcf.cloudfoundry.awsworkshop.io -u Student<YOUR STUDENT NUMBER> --skip-ssl-validation
(Password = Passw0rd)
----

Each student has been given OrgManager access to the Org matching the student name.
You will note that when you login, the Org is already selected.

Orgs and Spaces are using in various ways. Customers we have engagded with use orgs as a means of project or team segration. Spaces are also used for either project or environment segragation.

e.g:
org = team, space = project
org = team1, space = frontend
org = team1, space = midtier

org = project, space = env
org = frontend, space = dev
org = frontend, space = prod

In this module you:
- installed the cf cli
- used the cf cli to connect to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry apps manager
