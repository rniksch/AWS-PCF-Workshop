Step 7:: add the cf CLI:
----
For windows bash users:
wget -q -O - https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian/cli.cloudfoundry.org.key | sudo apt-key add - echo "deb https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudfoundry-cli.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cf-cli

or

sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudfoundry-cli.repo https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/fedora/cloudfoundry-cli.repo

sudo yum install cf-cli
----

Step 8:: Login to the PCF Foundation using the cf CLI:
----
cf login -a https://api.sys.pcf.cloudfoundry.awsworkshop.io -u Student<YOUR STUDENT NUMBER> --skip-ssl-validation
(Password = Passw0rd)
----

Each student has been given OrgManager access to the Org matching the student name.
You will note that when you login, the Org is already selected.

Orgs and Spaces are using in various ways. Customers we have engagded with use orgs as a means of project or team segration. Spaces are also used for either project or environment segragation.

e.g:
org = team, space = project
org = team1, space = frontend
org = team1, space = midtier

org = project, space = env
org = frontend, space = dev
org = frontend, space = prod

In this module you:
- installed the cf cli
- used the cf cli to connect to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry apps manager
