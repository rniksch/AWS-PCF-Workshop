what is Spring boot?

Spring Boot offers a fast way to build applications. It looks at your classpath and at beans you have configured, makes reasonable assumptions about what youâ€™re missing, and adds it. With Spring Boot you can focus more on business features and less on infrastructure. Spring does not write your code for you.


== Goals:
Take a starter Spring application extend on this by adding  functions for AWS services using the Spring-boot-AWS.
Further extend on the application by allowing for AWS Service broker and PCF integration.
